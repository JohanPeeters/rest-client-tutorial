This repo supports our ([Mich-b](https://github.com/Mich-b) and me) summer 2018 workshop on REST API access control. It illustrates 3 different API access control strategies on a React client:
* API keys
* OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials grant
* OpenID Connect Implicit Flow
There is a separate branch for each. Currently you are on the master branch. The master branch should be a good starting point to try to develop these strategies yourself. If you get stuck, you can refer to the feature branch that implements the strategy you are trying to learn.

Instructions for getting started will be given in the workshops.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and can be extended as such.
