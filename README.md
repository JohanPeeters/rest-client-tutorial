This repo supports our ([Mich-b](https://github.com/Mich-b) and me) summer 2018 workshop on REST API access control. You are currently looking at the ResourceUse branch in which the client gathers the user credentials to obtain an access token from the authorization server with the OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant. The access token is subsequently sent along with the API call.

```
